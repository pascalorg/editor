## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Viewer package used for marketplace + dashboard thumbnails (read-only embed, no editor overhead)
- Figma Community "duplicate" model for marketplace (preserves original, creates copy in workspace)
- Dribbble-style public profiles (self-contained; no separate portfolio app)
- Free-only marketplace for v1 (validate demand before monetization)
- All 5 public CTA links canonically use /signup (not /apply); /apply preserved for beta funnel
- Enterprise "Contact Sales" tier also routes through /signup for unified auth entry
- OG image uses next/og (bundled Next.js 16) — no @vercel/og install; Satori requires all styles inline
- twitter-image.tsx is a self-contained copy of opengraph-image (no cross-import; Next.js file convention)
- No @auth/prisma-adapter — manual signIn callback upsert preserves JWT session strategy; email as unique key prevents duplicate users
- allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true on GoogleProvider — safe for Google (verifies email); enables credential-user account linking
- BETTER_AUTH_SECRET renamed to NEXTAUTH_SECRET (was causing silent JWT signing failures)
- v1 password reset returns resetUrl in API response (no email provider); MUST be replaced with transactional email in v2
- Token stored as raw 64-char hex — acceptable for v1; v2 hardening: store SHA-256 of token instead
